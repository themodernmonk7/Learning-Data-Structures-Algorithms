Queue 

The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO)

The first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed 

A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (real/tail) and leave the queue from the other end (front/head).

The Queue data structure supports two main operations 
 - Enqueue, which adds and element to the real/tail of the collection
 - Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection
