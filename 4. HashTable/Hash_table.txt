A hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that is used to store key-value pairs

Given a key, you can associate a value with that key for very fast lookup
? Q? Do we not already have objects in JavaScript for that very same purpose?

JavaScript's Object is a special implementation of the hash table data structure. 
However, Object class adds its own keys. Keys that you input may conflict and overwrite the inherited default properties.
? But we did learn about the map data structure which overcomes these shortcomings, right?

Yes, Maps which were introduced in 2015 allow you to to store key-value pairs

Writing your own hash table implementation is a very popular JavaScript interview question.

Hash table store key value pairs
1. 'in' => 'India'
2. 'au' => 'Australia'
3. 'fr' => 'France'
4. 'It' => 'Italy'

We store the key value pairs in a fix sized array 
Arrays have a numeric index 
How do we go from using a string as an index to number as an index 
A hashing function accepts the string key, converts it into a hash code using a defined logic and then maps it into a numeric index that is within the bounds of the array 
Using the index, store the value
The same hashing function is reused to retrieve the value given a key 
        ✅ Set to store a key-value pair 
        ✅ Get to retrieve a value given its key 
        ✅ Remove to delete a key value pair

Hash Table Usage 
Hash tables are typically implemented where constant time lookup and insertion are required
