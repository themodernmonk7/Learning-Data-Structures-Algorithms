Tree 
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
A tree is a non-linear data strucure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structure.
In linear data structures, the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set.
Trees however, owing to the non-linear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data.
A tree will not contain any loops or cylcles.

Tree Terminology 

Binary Tree 
A binary tree is a data structure in which each nod ehas at most two children 
They are referred to as left child and right child

Binary Search Tree (BST)
The value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node 
The value of each right node must be greater than the parent node
Each node has at most two children 

Binary Search Tree Operations 
Insertion - To add a node to the tree
Search - To find a node given its value
DFS & BFS - To visit all nodes in the tree
Deletion - To remove a node given its value

Binary Search Tree Usage 
Searching
Sorting 
To implement abstract data types such as lookup tables and priority queues
