Graph: 
A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices (also called nodes) connected by edges 
Trees are a specific type of graph data structure 

Types of Graph: 
    - Directed 
        - A graph in which the edges have a direction 
        - Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed

    - Undirected
        - A graph in which the edges are bidirectional 
        - The graph can be traversed in either direction 
        - The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected

Graph Usage: 
    Google maps 
    Social media sites

Graph Representation 
    - Adjacency matrix 
        - An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in the graph 
        - Each row and column represent a vertex 
        - If the value of any element say, matrix[i][j] is 1, it represents that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j
