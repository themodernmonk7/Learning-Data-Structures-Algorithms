Fibonacci Sequence

Problem: Given a number 'n', find the first 'n' elements of the fibonacci sequence.

In mathematics, the fibonacci sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.
Fibonacci (2) = [0, 1]
Fibonacci (3) = [0, 1, 1]
Fibonacci (7) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
